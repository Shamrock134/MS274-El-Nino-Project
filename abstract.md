    "## Predicting the 3-Month Oscillating Nino Index of January 2024 and Forecasting the Strength of the 2023-24 El Nino\n",
    "\n",
    "This study delves into the ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillation) and its predictors, focusing on Sea Surface Temperature and Sea Surface Height for enhanced forecasting. Historical analyses, including the 1982 El Nino, uncover a warming trend, particularly in the North Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans, highlighting the changes in global climate in the past 40 years. A notable SSH increase since 1997 suggests potential impacts, requiring further investigation. The study predicts the 2023-24 El Nino's strength, revealing a strong correlation (R2 = 1.00) between the observed and modeled Oceanic Nino Index (ONI). From this, a 1.9Â°C value for the 3-month ONI for January 2024 is projected, placing this El Nino in between the moderate El Nino of 2009 and the strong El Nino of 1997. The findings contribute to ENSO understanding, emphasizing SST and SSH roles in predicting future events, with implications for climate change and sea-level rise."
