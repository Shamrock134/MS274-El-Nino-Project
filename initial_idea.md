# MS274-El-Nino-Project
## **Using satelite and in situ data from past ENSO events to predict the strength of the 2023 ENSO event.**
Warming SST's and slacking of the Tradewinds along the equatorial Pacific Ocean are indications of an El Nino event. Using the PODAAC data base, I will pull data for two satelite variables (SST and Wind Speed). These will be from the Mulit-scale Untra High Resolution (MUR) for SST and the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) for Wind Speed. I will also use data from the National Data Buoy Center data base for an in situ buoy variable (SST). The specific staion is # 51311 located @ ~140'W, 0'. Satelite data (SST and Wind Speed) from the same area ~140'W, 0' will also be analyzed. The two SST data sets will be evaluated for comparisons. The Multivariate ENSO (MEI) and the Oceanic Nino Index (ONI) will also be used for comparison. These data sets from past ENSO events as well as this past year will analyzed for any patterns or correlations that may be indicate the strength of the 2023 ENSO event. An SST or wind speed map will be generated using cartopy to show the study area. The plots will be past and present anomonies of wind speed and both satelite and in situ SST's.  The figure will be the results of my analysis and comparisons. See project_outline file for more detail including citations of papers I will use for my research.
