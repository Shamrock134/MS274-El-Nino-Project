# MS274-El-Nino-Project
## **Using satelite and in situ data from past ENSO events to predict the strength of the 2023 ENSO event.**
Warming SST's and slacking of the Tradewinds along the equatorial Pacific Ocean are indications of an El Nino event. Using the PODAAC data base, I will pull data for two satelite variables (SST and Wind Speed). These will be from the Mulit-scale Untra High Resolution (MUR) for SST and the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) for Wind Speed. I will also use data from the National Data Buoy Center data base for an in situ buoy variable (SST). The specific staion is # 51311 located @ ~140'W, 0'. I will analyze the satelite data from the same area ~140'W, 0'. I will compare the two SST data sets for similarities as well as the wind speed data.  I will also use other data to help analyze my findings. These will be the Multivariate ENSO (MEI) and the Oceanic Nino Index (ONI). I will take all these data sets from past ENSO events as well as this past year and see if there are any patterns or correlations  that may be indicate the strenght of the 2023 ENSO event. I'm exploring possiblilites for a Map. I may build one from QGIS or use cartopy to build an SST or wind speed map.  The plots will be past and present anomonies of wind speed and both satelite and in situ SST's.  The figure will be the results of my analysis and comparisons.
